Collaborative Filtering is the technique used to predict the data based on the data given by the peers.

The dataset used is the movielens dataset downloadable at https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/
<br>Download any dataset of your choice and place it at appropriate folder. Set the pathname as the parameters for functions in the program.

### Running
Go to the code folder via terminal and type 
```
python recommender.py
```
